# Malaria-Cases-Analysis-in-Africa-2007-2017
The analysis highlights significant disparities in malaria  burden across regions, with East and West Africa accounting for the majority of cases due to  factors such as limited healthcare access and environmental conditions conducive to malaria  transmission.

**Summary**

Between 2007 and 2017, Africa recorded 588 million malaria cases, with an average incidence  rate of 176.01 cases per 1,000 population. The study highlights significant disparities in malaria  burden across regions, with East and West Africa accounting for the majority of cases due to  factors such as limited healthcare access and environmental conditions conducive to malaria  transmission. Urban populations fared better than rural populations, reflecting disparities in  infrastructure and healthcare accessibility. Notable findings include a marked rise in reported  cases attributed to improved data reporting mechanisms and localized outbreaks. 

Key prevention measures, including anti-malarial drugs and bed nets, were observed to impact  case numbers positively, though their distribution remained uneven. The analysis underscores  the need for targeted interventions in high-burden regions like East, West, and Central Africa,  with a focus on rural areas. 

**Methods Used**

**Data Cleaning**

• Removed irrelevant columns (e.g., "Geometry," "Latitude"). 

• Replaced blank cells with 0 for consistency. 

• Grouped countries into regions for granular insights. 

**Power BI Tools** 

_**1. Custom Measures:**_

_o Totals:_ Cases, rural and urban populations. 

_**2. Visualizations:**_

o Bar charts: Regional case distribution. 

o Line charts: Annual trends. 

o Scatter plots: Bed net usage effectiveness. 

o Pie charts: Rural vs. urban population.

_**4. Filters:**_

o Interactive slicers for year, region, and country. 

**Key Metrics**

• _Total Cases Reported:_ 588 million. 

• _Average Malaria Incidence:_ 176.01 cases per 1,000 population. 

• _Average Drug Usage:_ 6.20 anti-malarial drugs per children under age of 5 annually. 

_• Average Bed Net Usage:_ 9.45 insecticide-treated bed nets per person annually.

_• Rural Population:_ 33,420 (56.84% of the total population). 

• _Urban Population:_ 25,380 (43.16% of the total population). 

**Detailed Observations**

_**1. Regional Analysis**_

_• East Africa:_

o 250.84M cases (42.66% of total). 

_o Contributing factors:_ High rural population, limited healthcare, and favourable environmental conditions. 

_• West Africa:  _

o 212.93M cases with the highest incidence average rate of 295.23 cases per  1,000.

o Challenges include lower drug usage and underutilization of bed nets. 

_• Central Africa:_  

o 116.31M cases with an incidence rate of 256.45 cases per 1,000. 

o Countries like Congo disproportionately contribute due to limited healthcare  access. 

_• North Africa:_

o Significantly fewer cases (7.27M) due to robust healthcare and less favorable  conditions for malaria transmission. 

_• Southern Africa:_

o 0.23M cases, reflecting localized outbreaks and effective interventions. 

_**2. Yearly Trends**_

• Malaria cases surged from 10M in 2007 to 128M in 2017, representing a 1,180%  increase. 

• 2014–2017 saw the steepest growth, possibly due to outbreaks or underuse of  preventive measures. 

_**3. Urban vs. Rural Analysis**_

_• Rural Areas:_

o Higher burden with 56.84% of cases attributed to lower healthcare access and  preventive resource distribution. 

_• Urban Areas:_

o Fewer cases (43.16%), supported by better infrastructure and intervention  programs. 

_**4. Country-Specific Insights**_ 

_• Congo:_

o The highest burden with 78M cases (13.19% of total). 

o Challenges include low bed net coverage and anti-malarial drug usage. 

_• Mozambique, Burkina Faso and Uganda:_  

o 44M, 42M and 41M cases, respectively, with high rural populations and  reliance on subsistence agriculture. 

_• Burundi and Nigeria: _

o Both recorded 40M approximately cases, marked by disparities in preventive  measure usage between rural and urban areas. 

_**5. Prevention Measures**_

_• Bed Net Usage:_ 

o Higher usage correlated with lower incidence rates, though regions like East  Africa still face high burdens due to compounding factors. 

**Key Insights for Decision-Making**

**Public Health Strategies**

_**1. High-Burden Regions:**_

o Focus interventions in East, West, and Central Africa. 

o Improve distribution of bed nets and anti-malarial drugs, particularly in rural  areas. 

**_2. Urban Areas:_**

o Maintain high intervention levels to prevent outbreaks.

**Policy Recommendations**

_• Collaborative Programs:_ Partner with governments in countries like Congo,  Mozambique, and Burkina Faso to develop sustainable prevention strategies. • Education Campaigns: Promote the consistent use of insecticide-treated bed nets,  especially in rural areas. 

**Data-Driven Interventions**

• Monitor yearly malaria incidence trends to assess the impact of interventions.

• Incorporate socio-economic indicators (e.g., poverty levels, education) in future studies  to better understand malaria prevalence. 

**Future Recommendations**

1. Analyse healthcare spending’s impact on malaria cases.
   
2. Study environmental factors (e.g., rainfall, temperature) influencing outbreaks.

3. Examine drug usage patterns for optimizing malaria reduction efforts.
